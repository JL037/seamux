// Answer an open AskUserQuestion by driving its dialog, so the model gets a
// real answer rather than an interrupted turn. Measured against Claude Code
// 2.1.281 and 2.1.282:
// - a digit picks an option on a single-select question and moves on,
//   submitting outright when there is only one question;
// - on a multi-select question digits toggle, and Tab moves on;
// - the row after the last option is "Type something". On a single-select
//   question its digit puts the cursor in it; on a multi-select one the
//   digit only ticks it, so the cursor walks down to it instead. Pasted text
//   there is taken as the answer and moves on. Typed text, which Claude Code
//   shows in full rather than folded, needs an Enter, or on a multi-select
//   question a Tab down to "Next" and an Enter;
// - a question whose options have previews shows each beside the list, has
//   no "Type something" row, and a digit there only moves the cursor, so an
//   Enter picks. Before it, n opens a note on the option under the cursor,
//   and typed text fills it; the Enter then picks with the note;
// - with several questions, or any multi-select one, a review screen comes
//   last, and 1 submits it.
