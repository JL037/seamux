# mDNS

Reaching the board on the local network by this Mac's `.local` name, behind the board's HTTP Basic credentials. Measured on macOS 26.5.1 with Vite 8.3.0 and React Router 7.18.4. [docs/remote-connections.md](../docs/remote-connections.md) is the setup guide.

In seamux: `lanHost`, `isLanHost`, `isLoopback` and `remoteGate` in [remote.server.ts](../app/lib/remote.server.ts). What the dev server does along the way is in [Vite and React Router](vite-and-react-router.md), including [Safari's cache](vite-and-react-router.md#vite-serves-its-pre-bundled-dependencies-as-immutable), which a phone on the network found first.

## `scutil --get LocalHostName` is the name Bonjour answers for

On a Mac whose `hostname` is `My-Mac.local`, it's `My-Mac`. macOS already answers for it on every network it joins, so seamux has nothing to advertise.

- **Measured:** macOS 26.5.1.
- **In seamux:** `lanHost` in [remote.server.ts](../app/lib/remote.server.ts).

## A Mac resolves its own `.local` name to `::1` first

`curl http://<name>.local:<port>/` on the Mac itself connects over loopback, so it counts as local. Testing a request from the network needs `--resolve <name>.local:<port>:<LAN address>`.

- **Measured:** macOS 26.5.1.
- **See also:** [Fake a request from the network](measuring.md#fake-a-request-from-the-network).

## Vite's `host: true` listens on `*` over IPv6, dual-stack

An IPv4 peer shows up as `::ffff:192.168.1.151`, and IPv4 loopback as `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, so the loopback check matches both forms.

- **Measured:** macOS 26.5.1, Vite 8.3.0.
- **In seamux:** `isLoopback` in [remote.server.ts](../app/lib/remote.server.ts).

## Vite refuses a `.local` name sent in capitals, before any plugin sees the request

`curl` to `http://Osmium.local:54321/` sends `Host: Osmium.local:54321` as typed, and the dev server answered 403 "Blocked request. This host ("Osmium.local") is not allowed.", while `Host: osmium.local:54321` got the board. A browser lowercases the name before sending it, so only scripts and Shortcuts met it. Vite's `isHostAllowed` compares the Host with `server.allowedHosts` case for case, and `lanHost` gives the name lowercased, as `osmium.local`. Vite adds that check to its middleware before it runs any plugin's `configureServer`, so seamux's own gate, a `configureServer` middleware, never saw the request. A `request` listener prepended on Vite's `httpServer` runs ahead of both.

- **Measured:** Vite 8.3.0, macOS 26.5.1.
- **In seamux:** `lowercaseHost` in [remote.server.ts](../app/lib/remote.server.ts), which [vite.config.ts](../vite.config.ts) prepends to the dev server's `request` listeners and [server/serve.ts](../server/serve.ts) runs first.
